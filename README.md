# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
### The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developer’s ability to:

- Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
- Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
- Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
- Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
## Requirement Gathering:
- Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
- Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
- Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
- Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
- Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

## Requirement Elicitation:
- Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
- Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

## Requirement Documentation:
- Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
- User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.
- Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

## Requirement Analysis and Modeling:
- Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
- Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
- Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

## Requirement Validation:
- Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
- Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

# Types of Requirements
## Functional Requirements:
Functional Requirements is basically what the system should or is expected to do.
Examples:
- Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
- User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
- Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
## Non-functional Requirements:
Non-functional Requirements is how the system should perform.
Examples:
- Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
- Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
- Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.

# Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are used to visually represent the interaction intended between the user and the system.
